            <p>Your friend <code>xena_p07</code> recently hacked into some places that should not be named, and most definitely not hacked. The government is after him and closing in quick.

            I'm born in Santo António, a neighbourhood of Funchal, Madeira, the youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener.I has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia.Mine great-grandmother Isabel da Piedade was from Cape Verde.
            <br>
            Mine family was staunchly Catholic. Ronaldo later claimed that he lived in poverty, sharing a room with his brother and sisters. I was expelled after he threw a chair at his teacher because he disrespected me. At age 14, I agreed with his mother to focus entirely on football. He states, "When I got to 14 I felt I had the potential. I thought I was maybe good enough at that time to play semi-professionally". I had started playing for amateur team Andorinha at age 8, where his father was the kit man. In 1995, aged 10, signed with local club Nacional, and, after a title-winning campaign, I went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who subsequently signed him for an undisclosed sum.
